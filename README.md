 ## Motivation and Goal of Project
    In today’s digital age, problematic internet use among children and  adolescents is a growing concern. Better understanding of this issue is crucial for addressing mental health problems such as depression and anxiety. Physical & fitness measures are extremely accessible and widely available with minimal intervention or clinical expertise. We propose using these easily obtainable physical fitness indicators as proxies for identifying problematic internet use, especially in contexts lacking clinical expertise or suitable assessment tools.

One business goal is contributing to a healthier, happier future where children are better equipped to navigate the digital landscape responsibly. A predictive model will be developed that analyses children's physical activity data to detect early indicators of problematic internet and technology use.

The data-mining goal of this project is to predict a participant's Severity Impairment Index (SII) from the given data, providing a standard measure of problematic internet use. The model's Quadratic Weighted Kappa score must be greater than 0, demonstrating performance better than random guessing.
